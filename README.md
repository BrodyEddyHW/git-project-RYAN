1. stage coded. It's been tested and works well
2. commit coded. It's been tested and works well
3. checkout coded. Doesn't work
4. issue with checkout, doesn't delete and sometimes converts folder to file, FileNotFoundException when I forgot to initialize head and when trying to access files when they were directories, IOException when I tried accessing files I forgot to intialize, etc. Fixed all but checkout error
